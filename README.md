<h1>Twitch API Website</h1>
<p>This site uses twitch's API to pull cool site data and visualize it using Google Charts. I wanted to graph live stream data, like the data shown in twitch's built in View Stats thingy, but the API doesn't currently have support for it. Not sure how to grab that data otherwise either.</p>
