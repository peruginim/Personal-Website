<h1>Twitch API Website</h1>
<p>This site uses twitch's API to pull cool site data and visualize it using Google Charts. I wanted to graph live stream data, like the data shown in twitch's built in View Stats thingy, but the API doesn't currently have support for it. Not sure how to grab that data otherwise either.
<br/>
Most up to date site code can be found in streampursuit.tv. All other directories are kept for reference.
<br/><h2>Update:</h2> Finished rough draft of first implementation of random stream selection. Now site users can go to the discover section and watch a random stream. Going to expand on this by letting users be more specific in their discover search (english language, specific game, etc). Also I want users to be able to like broadcasters and to follow them if they choose. As they go through random streams, liked streams are not only saved for them to go back to visit in the future, but this data can be compiled site-wide to get a leaderboard of sorts that shows the broadcasts with the most likes.
</p>

<h2>Update2:</h2>
Changing the name of the project to StreamPursuit.tv with a brand new domain name. Currently the site has discover working (with the exclusion of "Like" which still has to be finished). Next steps are to finish Like and to give user's a more powerful random search. Also have to change colors of site to not get in trouble with Twitch's Brand Assets Guidelines (http://www.twitch.tv/p/brandassets).
